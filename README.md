# OpenGL-Rubiks_Cube

This repository contains the final executable, the visual studio project, and a zip file with the necessary libraries to run the VS project. To run the executable, just run cube.exe in the release folder. The release folder contains the executable and various assets to ensure that it can run (fonts, DLLs, shaders, etc). In order to run the VS project and compile the code, make sure that the contents of the vslibraries zip file are extracted to documents/vslibraries, in order to ensure that VS knows where to link the libraries from.
